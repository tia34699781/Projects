F!nd one recruit
This web app is a portal between a recruiter and a candidate. I was inspired by my father to make this web app. In this web app, you can register
as a recruiter or a candidate. A recruiter can offer jobs, edit jobs, see notifications, see candidate's profile, see reports of jobs and accept
or decline a candidate's request. A candidate can apply for jobs, see notifications, accept or decline job offers and see the reports of jobs
industry-wise. This web app is spacially for recruiters to make their recruitment process automatic. In the reports page of recruiter it shows
the jobs that most of the candidates are looking for while in the reports page of candidate it shows the jobs which are posted the most by the
recruiters. I have made it using python, Sqlite3, flask, Jquery, data tables, bootstrap, and anychart.
